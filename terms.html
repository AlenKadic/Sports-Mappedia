  <section>
    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Sports Mappedia<span class="tm" aria-hidden="true">™</span> is currently maintained by a volunteer collective
      (the “Sports Mappedia<span class="tm" aria-hidden="true">™</span> Volunteers”, “we”, “our”, or “us”).
      If we later operate through a company or another legal entity,
      references to “we/us” will automatically refer to that successor entity.
      You can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sportsmappedia.com">info@sportsmappedia.com</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2) What these Terms cover</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms govern your access to and use of the Sports Mappedia<span class="tm" aria-hidden="true">™</span> website and any related content,
      features, and services we make available (collectively, the “Service”).
      By using the Service you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3) Unofficial, informational only</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided for general information and personal use.
      It does not constitute official guidance, ticketing, transport advice, or professional recommendations.
      Venue locations, gates, parking, event times, and other details can change; always confirm with official sources.
      Use caution and follow local laws and safety instructions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4) Third-party services & content</h2>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party providers, including Mapbox (maps/tiles/directions),
      Google (geocoding/search libraries, Google Sheets hosting), jsDelivr, and others.
      Their terms and privacy practices apply in addition to ours.
      We do not control third-party availability or accuracy.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Examples: Map visuals & directions are served by Mapbox; the site may fetch publicly shared data
      from Google Sheets; and static libraries may be loaded from reputable CDNs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5) Acceptable use</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Do not scrape, index at scale, or bypass rate limits/usage controls.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to access non-public systems, tokens, or data.</li>
      <li>Respect third-party license terms (e.g., Mapbox, data sources, trademarks).</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      We retain rights in our own branding, layout, and original content.
      Map data, tiles, and styles are provided under their respective licenses (e.g., Mapbox and its data providers).
      Names, logos, and marks of teams, events, venues, and organizations are the property of their respective owners.
      Using the Service does not grant you rights in those third-party assets.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7) No accounts or paid features</h2>
    <p>
      The current Service does not require a user account and does not sell paid features.
      We are not accepting donations or sponsorships yet on the website.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8) Monetization (future-facing)</h2>
    <p>
      We may accept voluntary donations and/or display advertising in the future to support hosting and development.
      Donations would be voluntary, not a purchase of specific features, and generally non-refundable unless required by law.
      Any payment processing or ad delivery would be handled by third parties with their own terms and privacy practices
      (see our Privacy Policy for details when/if enabled).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9) Availability; changes; experimental status</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is experimental and may change or be unavailable at any time.
      We may update features, policies, or the Service itself, or transition to a commercial offering in the future.
      If we make material changes to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, we’ll update the “Last updated” date and,
      where required, provide notice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10) Disclaimers; limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, the Service is provided “as is” and “as available.”
      We make no warranties about accuracy, reliability, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
      To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, data, or goodwill arising out of or related to your use
      of the Service. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in that case,
      the limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by local law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or stop providing the Service, or your access to it, if we believe you are not complying with
      these Terms or if we discontinue the Service. You may stop using the Service at any time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12) Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are intended to comply with mandatory consumer laws that may apply to you.
      If no mandatory local law applies, these Terms are governed by the laws of Croatia,
      without regard to conflict-of-law rules. In all cases, you can contact us first and we will try to resolve
      issues informally.
