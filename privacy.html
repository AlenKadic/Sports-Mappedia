    <h2>What we (currently) collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pseudonymous client ID (“cid”)</strong> — generated and stored in your browser’s localStorage to help enforce
          per-client rate limits and protect our API budget. We don’t know who you are from this alone.<br>
          <em>Retention:</em> stored in your browser until you clear it. We do not persist cid in our sheet/database;
          it is only used transiently (about 60 seconds) in memory to enforce per-minute limits.</li>

      <li><strong>Usage counter (aggregate only)</strong> — our Google Apps Script updates a monthly counter
          (month, count, blocked flag, last alert time). No personal data is saved there.</li>

      <li><strong>Geolocation (optional)</strong> — only if you click “Locate Me,” your browser shares your current location
          so we can center the map and drop a marker. We do not store your location.</li>

      <li><strong>Local settings</strong> — small UI preferences saved in your browser (e.g., whether the welcome gate was
          dismissed for 24h; whether the filter panel is collapsed; auto-hide toggle). These never leave your device unless
          your browser syncs them.</li>

      <li><strong>Third-party technical data</strong> — our providers (e.g., Mapbox, Google, GitHub Pages, jsDelivr) may process
          IP address, device/browser info, and events necessary to deliver the map and site securely. See their privacy notices
          for details.</li>

      <li><strong>Emails you send us</strong> — if you write to <a href="mailto:info@sportsmappedia.com">info@sportsmappedia.com</a>,
          your message is routed/hosted by our email providers (e.g., Gmail/ImprovMX/Brevo SMTP) for the purpose of responding.
          We do not build marketing lists.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why we process data (legal bases)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — site security, abuse prevention, rate limiting/budget protection,
          service reliability, and troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> — geolocation (only after your browser prompts you and you accept).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:6px;">
      <em>GDPR specifics:</em> For EU/UK users, our legal bases are <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (GDPR <strong>Art. 6(1)(f)</strong>)
      for security/abuse prevention and service delivery, and <strong>consent</strong> (GDPR <strong>Art. 6(1)(a)</strong>) for optional geolocation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What we don’t do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No user accounts.</li>
      <li>No marketing emails or newsletters.</li>
      <li>No behavioral/targeted advertising.</li>
      <li>No sale of personal data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers/partners</strong>: Mapbox (maps/tiles/directions/search), Google (Apps Script/Sheets),
          GitHub Pages (hosting), jsDelivr (CDN), and email/forwarding/SMTP providers as needed to receive and send messages.
          They act as independent controllers or processors of technical data needed to deliver their services.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal/safety</strong>: where required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect our rights, users, and the public.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our providers may process data globally. They use measures such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other safeguards
      described in their policies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>cid & UI preferences</strong>: stored in your browser until you clear site data.</li>
      <li><strong>In-memory throttle data</strong>: ~60 seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate monthly counter sheet</strong>: kept as needed to manage capacity and audit abuse (no personal data).</li>
      <li><strong>Emails</strong>: kept as long as reasonably necessary to respond and maintain records of correspondence.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your rights (EU/UK and similar jurisdictions)</h2>
    <p>
      You may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, <strong>portability</strong> (where applicable),
      or object to processing, and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Because we don’t maintain
      user-identifying records for normal browsing, we may ask for reasonable information to locate any data
      (e.g., your email if you contacted us).
    </p>
    <p>
      To exercise rights, contact: <a href="mailto:info@sportsmappedia.com">info@sportsmappedia.com</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Automated decisions & profiling</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> conduct profiling or make automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects.
      Temporary request throttling may occur to protect the service but has no lasting effects.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not directed to children under 13. Do not use “Locate Me” without parental consent where required by law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to a small, volunteer project (e.g., least-privilege
      access to sheets/scripts, limited data collection, HTTPS via GitHub Pages). No internet service is 100% secure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We’ll update this policy as the Service evolves. See the “Last updated” date at the top.
